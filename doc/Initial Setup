Prerequisites
   Git - can download github desktop for windows from https://desktop.github.com/
         and git for windows to get command line usage from : https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases
   Docker - can install docker for windows from https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
         Then had to update wsl with from command line: 
              wsl --update
   Python for windows from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
         Then can also install pipenv (ran the following from administrator cmd file:
              pip install pipenv 
    
See information here: https://github.com/KatjaGlassConsulting/OpenStudyBuilderScripts/blob/main/doc/InstallationExperiences.md
   
This gets you to running the basic, but latest libraries of CT are missing, and CDISC SEND CT is missing
    See information here to load the CTs: https://github.com/KatjaGlassConsulting/OpenStudyBuilderScripts/blob/main/doc/InstallationExpStandards.md
    Needed this line as python version I have is newer:
          pipenv install --python 3.10
    Following that, 
         created .env file in mdr-standards-import directory as explained and ran the download script
	     (database name is from when I created it: mdrdb-2023.04.02-16.05)
	 
             pipenv run python -m mdr_standards_import.cdisc_ct.dev_scripts.download_json_data_from_cdisc_api 
	          (left out cdisc_data\packages at the end, as that will be default)
         and load cts after just having the ones I wanted (CDISC SEND) in the cdisc_data\packages directory	
             pipenv run python -m mdr_standards_import.cdisc_ct.dev_scripts.bulk_import 'TEST' . true
	 then the SEND CT list is now available on the Library -> Code lists -> CT Packages page
