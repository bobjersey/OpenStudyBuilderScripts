Nonclinical changes

1) Code lists - load SEND CT lists
2) Defining a study
     a) Study title - perhaps here put a selection of Clinical vs NonClinical study
     b) Registry identifiers page does not apply to nonclinical
     c) Study properties - all choices, like study type, should come from SEND CT instead of clinical ST
     d) Study population - should instead have appropriate for nonclinical: Species, Strain, Age range, Number of males, Number of females
