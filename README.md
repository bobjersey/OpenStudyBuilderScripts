### Code, Scripts & Content (not referenced in third-party-licenses)

This project is using "Unlicence", feel free to use the scripts and documentation as you like without warrenty or the need to reference. Some content might come from third party using a different license, that license should always apply (e.g. example datasets copied/modified from PHUSE Script repository using MIT) - I store a third-party-licens.md file along those.
